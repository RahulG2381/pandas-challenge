## School Summary:
In the provided dataset, which includes both "Government" and "Independent" school types, several key insights can be drawn from the analysis of various school metrics. Bailey High School stands out as the largest school with 4,976 students and the highest total budget of $3,124,928.00, while Cabrera High School has the smallest budget per student at $582.00. Griffin High School, an Independent school, demonstrates notable academic performance with the highest average reading score (71.79) and the highest overall passing rate (81.34%). In contrast, Figueroa High School, a Government school, exhibits a lower overall passing rate (67.47%). Notably, Bailey High School leads in both math and reading passing percentages, showcasing a strong academic performance despite its larger size. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the diverse characteristics and academic achievements across the schools in the dataset.

## Maths and reading scores by Year:
Schools such as Shelton High School and Thomas High School consistently maintain high average math scores across all year levels, indicating a strong academic performance throughout the high school years.
Schools such as Pena High School, Shelton High School, and Wright High School consistently maintain high average reading scores across all year levels, indicating a strong focus on literacy and reading skills.
## Scores by School Spending:
Higher spending ranges show higher percentages in both passing math and passing reading categories. Schools in the $585-615 spending range have the highest passing rates in both math (91.59%) and reading (86.67%), leading to the highest overall passing rate (89.13%).
## Scores by School Size:
Small-sized schools outperform in both passing math (91.14%) and passing reading (87.19%), leading to the highest overall passing rate (89.16%). Medium-sized schools also show competitive passing rates, while large-sized schools have lower percentages in both categories.
## Scores by School Type:
Students enrolled in Independent schools outperformed the students enrolled in Government schools in all categories. They had higher average scores as well as better passing rates. Students in both Government and Independent schools had relatively better performance in Maths as compared to reading especially in terms of the passing rates. Overall passing rates for both Government and Independent schools are lower than the passing rates in maths and reading. This indicates that not all students getting a passing score in maths are getting the same for reading and vice versa.
